# Orange HexCompare
~~A Visual Hex File Compare Tool written in Python using Kivy~~
(Will be Visual/GUI once I can ge Kivy working)
A Terminal-based Hex File compare tool

Since there's no good Hex compare tool I could find for mac, I decided to make my own.

It's currently a work in progress, but the goal is to make it like other popular hex compare tools (HexFiend) but with
greater compatibility and cross-platform
